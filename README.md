# HelperScripts

Made in 2023 by gaenssle

This is a library of small scripts that help process data.
All of them work are executed over the terminal with the file(s) as input arguments. E.g.:
python3 RemoveEmptyLines.py Test.txt

The current list of small scripts includes:
-Removal of empty lines in a file
-Conversion of column separator
-Conversion of decimal and thousand separator
-Stack and unstack of data saved in tables
-Comparison of files to check for missing lines
-Conversion on a list of KEGG gene IDs to a list of KEGG genome IDs
